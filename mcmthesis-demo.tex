\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Problem Background}
		\par As narcotic analgesics, opioids are primarily used for pain relief and anesthesia to reduce patients' suffering, which contribute a lot to modern medicine since its appearance. However, it also has many side effects, including itchiness, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and, what counts most, addiction. Considering the adverse effects above, we tend to enforce the regulation of opioids to reduce the risk of addiction.
		
		Nowadays, The United States is undergoing one of its worst drug crises caused by opioids. Hundreds of people die from opioid-related overdoses while more and more Americans are suffering from opioid addiction. The crisis has reached such a scale that, beyond the risks it brings to public health, the loss of people with advanced degrees will curb the development of economy and national security.
		
		With the data offered by Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of Diversion Control about the situation of drug abusing in five states, we can know more about the characteristics of opioid epidemic and find out the factors contributing to the growth in opioid use and addiction, so that we can set a therapy to alleviate the problem.


	\subsection{View of Our Work}
		\par For the first Problem, to describe the spread of opioids disorder, we manage to calculate the weight of each county with geographic information and drug cases, and we can adjust the weights with fully connected neural network. Then we build a LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network , which attempts to model time or sequence dependent behaviour, in order to predict multiple output time series based on multiple input time series, so that we can predict the number o/f drug case in all the counties next year.
		\par By comparing the predicted data and the data before, we can clearly find which place in all counties has the tendency to increase and view these counties as specific concerns. We found that the drug abuse cases tend to increase in the counties which are historically trapped in opioids overdose.		
		\par For the second problem, we need to take the census data into consideration. So we make a new input branch for our model to obtain the influence of social-economy influence. The new branch consists of three autoencoder layers, the output of the autoencoder will be put into merge layer, where the model can capture the most salient features of the training data.	
		\par Finally, we can analyze comprehensively to create a strategy to help governments counter the opioids crisis.
	\subsection{Assumptions}

		\par Due to the limited data of the pentential drug abuse cases, and other soc........,we use the
		following assumptions to complete our model. These simplified assumptions will be used through our paper and can be improved with more reliable data:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The count of drug abuse cases in a county can be regared as a presentation of the total drug abuse cases in this county.
			\item The total drug abuse cases in a county is proportional to the count data we get. This is reasonable because ..................
			\item Neglect the diffierence of opioid medicine on kind, we view all the instance of opioid as one to our model.
		\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Applies widely}\\
This  system can be used for many types of airplanes, and it also
solves the interference during  the procedure of the boarding
airplane,as described above we can get to the  optimization
boarding time.We also know that all the service is automate.
\item \textbf{Improve the quality of the airport service}\\
Balancing the cost of the cost and the benefit, it will bring in
more convenient  for airport and passengers.It also saves many
human resources for the airline. \item \textbf{}
